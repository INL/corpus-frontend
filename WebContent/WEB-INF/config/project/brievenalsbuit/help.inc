		Welcome to the <i>Brieven als Buit</i> search. You can search the contents of the <i>Brieven als Buit</i> collection via a simple search interface and via CQL. Searching this historical text material is possible because of linguistic annotation with Part of Speech and Modern Lemma of each word in the text. For more information on this, see also: <a href="http://www.kennislink.nl/publicaties/nieuwe-vondsten-in-oude-brieven" target="_blank">http://www.kennislink.nl/publicaties/nieuwe-vondsten-in-oude-brieven</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Simple Search</h3>
	<p>
		You can search for words matching one or more of the three properties: WORD FORM LEMMA and  PART OF SPEECH. Use the search boxes on the top left of the website&#39;s home page.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>word form</b> is an occurrence of a word in the text.  By typing <i>capteijn</i> ('captain') in the word form search box, you will find the occurrences of <i>capteijn</i> in the collection.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since <i>capteijn</i> is only one of the possible historical spellings for <i>“kapitein”</i>, searching for all spellings is done by looking for the Modern Dutch <b>lemma</b> <i>kapitein</i>. Due to the presence of clitic forms in this collection, one word in the text may stand for multiple lemma's. Type in <i>*_kapitein|kapitein|kapitein_*</i> to search for all occurrences of kapitein.
    </p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to search for words with a specific <b>Part of Speech</b> in the text. For example if you want to know which <i>prepositions</i> were used in the text, search for <i>adp</i> in the <b>Part of Speech</b> search field.
	</p>
	<p>
		Combining features is possible when searching. If you are looking for the lemma <i>leven</i> as a verb ('to live'), type <i>leven</i> in the <b>Lemma search box</b> and <i>vrb</i> in the <b>Part of Speech search box</b>. You will find all instances of the verb <i>leven</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Searching with a <b>* wildcard</b> is also possible. For example, in order to search for all words containing <i>lopen</i> ('walk'), you can do that by typing <i>*lopen*</i> in the lemma search box. Wildcard search is supported for WORDFORM, LEMMA and PART OF SPEECH searches. The <b>*</b> (asterisk) symbol matches <i>zero or more</i> characters.
    </p>
	<p>
		Searching for a <b>word group</b> is also possible by simply typing the word group in the search box. Typing <i>lief man</i> ('sweet husband/man') in the lemma search box will give you all occurrences of words with the lemma <i>lief</i> immediately followed by words with the lemma <i>man</i>. If you want to search for the combination <i>het leven</i> ('the life') where leven is a noun, type the string <i>het leven</i> in the <b>lemma search box</b> and <i>art nou</i>  in the <b>Part of Speech search box</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The list of Part of Speech tags is:
		<ul>
			<li>VRB: verb</li>
            <li>NOU: noun</li>
			<li>NEPER: person name</li>
			<li>NEORG: organisation name, e.g. <i>VOC</i></li>
			<li>NELOC: location name. e.g. street name, city, region, country</li>
			<li>NEOTHER: other named entities, e.g. name of a ship</li>
			<li>ADJ: adjective</li>
			<li>ADP: adposition</li>
			<li>ADV: adverb</li>
			<li>ART: article</li>
			<li>NUM: numeral</li>
			<li>PRN: pronoun/determiner</li>
			<li>CON: conjunction</li>
			<li>INT: interjection</li>
			<li>RES: residual, e.g. abbreviations</li>
			<li>UNRESOLVED: lemma or part of speech unclear</li>
        </ul>
		Search can be performed by clicking on SEARCH in the window or using ENTER on your keyboard. By clicking on RESET, all selections or information in search boxes will be cleared.

	<h3>Filtering by metadata</h3>
	<p>
    	All the above mentioned searches are performed on the complete corpus. If you want to search in a particular subset of the material, you can do that by
    	using the metadata information accompanying each letter in the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The metadata information is structured as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
    	A search can be performed by using information in the tabs LETTER, SENDER, ADDRESSEE and SENT FROM. Per tab, it is possible to specify criteria by which to
    	search.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In the tab LETTER, you can specify your search by using the following filter criteria: YEAR, TEXT TYPE, AUTOGRAPH, SIGNATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In the tab SENDER, you can specify your search by using the following filter criteria NAME, GENDER, CLASS, AGE, REGION OF RESIDENCE, RELATIONSHIP TO ADDRESSE.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In the tab ADDRESSEE, you can specify your search by using the following filter criteria NAME, PLACE, COUNTRY, REGION, SHIP.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In the tab SENT FROM, you can specify your search by using the following filter criteria PLACE, COUNTRY, REGION, SHIP.
    </p>
	<p>
    	The filters are presented either as text input fields where you can type one or more words, or by option lists. In the option lists, multiple items
    	can be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The text input fields work in a similar way as in Google. When entering two terms into the text input fields, e.g. <em>Jan Pieters</em>, the application
    	searches for either <em>Jan</em> OR <em>Pieters</em> OR both<em>. </em>By using quotes ("<em>Jan Pieters</em>"), results will only contain the word
    	group.<em></em>
    </p>
    <p>
    	<em>Some further explanation of the filter criteria:</em>
		<ul>
    	<li>SENDER: person who sent the letter. Note that this is not necessarily the writer of the letter, see below on autograph.</li>
		<li>ADDRESSEE: person the letter was sent to.</li>
		<li>YEAR: date as it is found on the letter.</li>
		<li>SENT FROM: place the letter is sent from.</li>
		<li>SENT TO: place the letter is sent to.</li>
		<li> TEXT TYPE: private letter or business letter. The majority of letters in the corpus are private letters. Letters to relatives and friends containing both
    	personal and commercial information are considered private letters.</li>
		<li>AUTOGRAPH: Three groups of letters are distinguished according to their autograph status. In the case of autographs, it is established that the sender of
    	the letter is also the person who wrote the letter. In the case of non-autographs, it is established that the sender of the letter is not identical to the person who wrote the letter. In the case of uncertain letters, research has as yet not confirmed whether the letter is an autograph or not.</li>
		<li>SIGNATURE: the signature in the High Court of Admiralty Archives (HCA), kept in The National Archives in Kew (UK).</li>
		<li>NAME: the name of the sender or addressee.</li>
		<li>GENDER: the gender of the sender or addressee.</li>
		<li>AGE: Three age groups are distinguished: below 30, 30 to 50 years old, and over 50.</li>
		<li>CLASS: Four social strata are distinguished, based on the stratification that is commonly used by social historians (cf. Willem Frijhoff & Marijke Spies, 1650. <i>Bevochten eendracht</i>. The Hague, 1999: Sdu, pp. 188-190). The four strata are called lower class (LC), lower middle class (LMC), upper middle class (UMC) and upper class (UC). 'Lower class' refers to sailors, servants, soldiers and have-nots. The lower middle class comprises the petty bourgeoisie, e.g. petty shopkeepers, small craftsmen, minor officials. The upper middle class comprises the prosperous middle class (or brede burgerij), e.g. big storekeepers, uncommissioned officers, well-to-do farmers. 'Upper class' refers to the bourgeoisie (or grote burgerij), e.g. wealthy merchants, shipowners, academics, commissioned officers. Note that 'upper class' (UC) does not refer to the highest social layer that is usually distinguished, comprising the nobility and the non-noble ruling classes, which are not represented in the corpus.</li>
		<li>RELATIONSHIP TO ADDRESSEE: the relationship, personal and/or professional, that the sender has with regard to the addressee (e.g. father, daughter, cousin, friend, employer).</li>&nbsp;
		<li>
			PLACE and REGION OF RESIDENCE: Two types of locality are distinguished.
			<ul>
			<li>PLACE is the place from/to which a letter is sent, indicating the origin or destination of the letter.</li>
			<li>REGION OF RESIDENCE refers to the region where a sender was born and raised or where he has spent most of his life, indicating his regional background. Region of residence is usually a Dutch dialect area or province, such as Zeeland, South Holland or North Holland. Note that the metropolis of Amsterdam, despite being part of North Holland, constitutes a separate region of residence for demographic reasons.</li>
			</ul>
			The corpus contains, for example, many letters sent from the Caribbean, written by people originating from Holland and Zeeland, who are either travelling or settling in the Caribbean. In such cases, the place of the sender is, for example, Curacao, and the place of the addressee is Vlissingen, whereas the region of residence may be Zeeland. 
		</li>
		<li>PLACE can be specified by COUNTRY and REGION. 'Region' refers to two different things. Within the language area, it is important to know which dialect area or province the letter is sent to/from, in order to establish regional background information and to enable research on regional variation. Outside the language area, region indicates a geographical region such as the Caribbean. Distinguishing this kind of regions allows us to analyze, for example, all letters sent from the Caribbean in a certain period. Therefore, places within the Dutch language area are specified by a region that refers to a dialect area or province, and by the name of a country indicating either the Netherlands or Belgium. A letter sent from Rotterdam, for instance, is categorized as follows: place = Rotterdam, region = Zuid-Holland (South Holland), country = Nederland (Netherlands).
		<br/><br/>
		Places outside of the Dutch language area are specified by country and region, which here refers to (parts of) continents. A letter sent from Basseterre on the island of Saint-Kitts is categorized as follows: place = Basseterre, country = Saint-Kitts, region = Caraïbisch gebied (Caribbean). The regions distinguished outside of the language area include Noord-Europa (Northern Europe), Zuid-Europa (Southern Europe), Caraïbisch gebied (Caribbean), Noord-Amerika (North America), Noord-Afrika (North Africa), West-Afrika (West Africa), Zuid-Afrika (South Africa) and Azië (Asia).
		<br/><br/>
		Note that for most places, regions and countries contemporary names are used, which means, for example, that Ceylon is called Sri Lanka in the application, and Sint Christoffel is called Saint-Kitts. It is also possible to search the metadata information only. In that case only the “per document view” is given (see below).</li>
		</ul>
    </p>
	<h3>Search results</h3>
	Search results can be presented in four different ways: Per hit, Per document, Hits Grouped, Documents Grouped.
	<h4>Per Hit</h4>
	<p>
    	Here the search results are presented in the form of concordances, the word searched for in context. The word that is searched for (the hit), is in bold
    	type and supplied with the information on its Modern Dutch lemma and part of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The number of concordances per page can be determined by choosing the number from the drop-down list after SHOW ME. The number of pages that can be
    	displayed are presented above the concordances. By clicking on a number or on NEXT you can see the results of another page.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To view in which documents the hits were found, click on TOGGLE TITLES. By clicking on TOGGLE TITLES again, the titles disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Clicking on a title is the way to view the complete document: metadata, text and images. Within the text, the hits are highlighted. By hovering over the
    	words in the text, the linguistic annotation with Part of Speech and Lemma is visible. The images become visible by clicking on the tab IMAGES. To go back to the text
    	view, click on the tab TEXT.
    </p>
    <p>
    	By clicking on a concordance line, more context is presented.
    </p>
    <p>
    	There are several ways in which you can change the order of the concordances.
    </p>
    <p>
    	By clicking on LEFT CONTEXT and choosing "word" the concordances are sorted by ordering the word to the left of the hittext alphabetically. You can do the same
    	for RIGHT CONTEXT. By clicking on HIT TEXT or LEMMA or PART OF SPEECH, Hits or Lemma's or PoS's are presented in alphabetical order. To go from ascending
    	to descending alphabetical order or vice versa, simply click on the chosen item again.
    </p>
	<h4>Per Document</h4>
	<p>
    	To have a better overview of the documents in which your search was successful, switch to the per-document view by clicking on PER DOCUMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The documents are listed, with one example accompanied by information on the date of the document and the total number of occurrences of the hit text in
    	the document.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The complete document can be viewed by either clicking on the title or on VIEW DOCUMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
    	There are several ways in which you can change the order of the documents.
    </p>
    <p>
    	By clicking on DOCUMENT TITLE, the information is presented in alphabetical order. To go from ascending to descending alphabetical order or vice versa,
    	simply click on DOCUMENT TITLE again.
    </p>
    <p>
    	By clicking on YEAR, the documents are presented in chronological order. To go from chronological order to reverse chronological order and vice versa,
    	simply click on YEAR again.
    </p>
    <p>
    	By clicking on HITS, the documents are ordered by frequency. To go from low to high frequency or vice versa, simply click on HITS again.
    </p>
	<h4>Hits Grouped</h4>
	<p>
    	In this view the search result can be grouped in different ways, all related to the hit text, which makes a first analysis of the search results easier. To
    	use this view, click on HITS GROUPED. Then select in the drop down list the feature by which you want to group your search results. This can be <i>document
		title, hit text, lemma, hit PoS, lemma and PoS, word left, word right</i> or <i>year</i>. For instance, grouping the result of a query by lemma <em>vrouw</em> ('wife') <em>by hit text</em> will display the frequency of occurrence of each word form in the paradigm of the lemma.
    </p>
    <p>
    	It is possible to see concordances of one group in the overview by clicking on the green bar with the frequency number. In the concordance view that
    	appears, you can get more concordances in the same view by clicking on LOAD MORE CONCORDANCES. To restore the original view without concordances, click on
    	the same green bar again. It is possible to get a more detailed view of the concordances in a group, by clicking on VIEW DETAILED CONCORDANCES IN THIS
    	GROUP. However, to change from the detailed concordances view back to the per-hit view, the search has to be repeated.
    </p>
	<h4>Documents Grouped</h4>
	<p>
    	This view is similar to "Hits grouped" but now the data is grouped in different ways, all related to information on the document. To use this view, click
    	on DOCUMENTS GROUPED. Then select in the drop-down list the feature by which you want to group your search results. This can be <i>number of hits, by year and by
    	author</i>. <i>Number of hits</i> gives the number of documents per frequency of hits in a document of your search result, <i>by year</i> gives the number of documents
    	per year in your search result, <i>by author</i> gives the number of documents per author in your search result.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To see the documents per overview, do the same as described in "Hits grouped", be it that now you see an orange bar.
    </p>
	<h3>CQL query</h3>
	<h4>Corpus Query Language</h4>
	<p>Click on the tab “CQL query”  to use the Corpus Query Language. This is an advanced query language developed at IMS, University of Stuttgart in the early 1990s, designed to support very specific retrieval of phrase types in the corpus. It expresses phrase queries as sequences of token queries. It is therefore mainly useful if you want to find specific types of phrases in a larger text. An example of a simple query (note that the quotes are required):
	<code>"grote" ".*heid"</code>.</p>
	<p>This is how you search for the word “grote” followed by a word ending with “heid”, using regular expressions to specify the pattern for the second word. Equivalent to the above query is: 
	<code>[word="grote"] [word=".*heid"]</code> which has the typical form of a CQL query: a phrase query built up from token queries surrounded by square brackets.</p>
    <h4>Single token queries</h4>
	<p>These typically consist of a combination of simple attribute value queries in the form of either:
	<ul>
        <li>token attribute=single token regular expression <code>[word=".*heid"]</code> surrounded by square brackets</li>
		<li>default token attribute regular expression <code>".*heid"</code></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>In this corpus, the following token attributes are available for querying:
	<ul>
		<li>word - The word as it was written. This is the default attribute in this corpus, so queries in the form (2) search for word forms</li>
		<li>lemma - Dictionary headword form of words</li>
		<li>pos - Part of speech</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	A typical example using all three token attributes: <code>[pos="adj"] [lemma="man" & word != "man"]</code>. This is how you search for adjectives followed by the noun “man”, appearing in any form not equal to the dictionary headword form.
    </p>
	<h4>Phrase queries</h4>
	<p>
	As you have seen, phrase queries can simply consist of a sequence of single token queries. Apart from this, regular expression  notations are available to express sequences of tokens. For example:
	<code>"der.*"{2,}</code>. This query finds two or more successive words starting with "der". At the token level, regular expression operators such as *, + and ? are available. Another example: <code>[pos="a.*"]+ "man"</code>. This will find the word "man" with one or more adjectives applied to it. 
    </p>
	<h4>Summary of Corpus Query Language support</h4>
	<p>
		The following CQL constructs are supported:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Token constraints of the form [word="koe"] or "koe" (default property). Constraint values may be regular expressions, e.g. [word="str.+"] . The regular expression operators are:
			<ul>
                <li><code>.</code> (full stop) matches arbitrary character: b.k finds bok, bak, bek, bik, etc.. </li>
				<li><code>*</code> matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding letter or bracketed group:	.*schip finds words ending with schip (also matching “schip”), dia.* finds words beginning with dia, .*deel.* finds words with deel in the middle.</li>
				<li><code>+</code> matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding letter or bracketed group: .+schip finds words ending with schip (not matching “schip”)</li>
				<li><code>{n,m}</code> matches a sequence of n to m occurrences of preceding letter or group. Use {n} to find a sequence of length n, {n,}  to find at least n, {0,n} to find at most n: <code>[word=".*[aeiou]{5,6}.*"]</code> finds words containing a group of 5 or 6 vowels</li>
				<li><code>?</code> The bracketed items are optional characters: blond(e)? finds blond and blonde </li>
				<li><code>|</code> Vertical bar (disjunction): paard|koe|schaap  searches for all of these items</li>
				<li><code>[]</code> Square brackets (character groups): b[ae]k finds bak, bek</li>
				<li><code>\</code>Backslash To search for a full stop, use the backslash and the full stop: Dr\. finds Dr.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Constraints may be combined by using boolean operators, both between token specifications (e.g. "stad" | "dorp" ) and within token specifications (e.g. [lemma="zijn" & type="ww.*"] ). Supported boolean operators are ! (not), & (and) and | (or). Implication (->) is not supported yet. Parentheses may be used to group expressions. 
			</li>
            <li>Phrase searches, by putting several token specifications in sequence, e.g.: "de" [lemma="koe"] </li>
            <li>You can apply regular expression operators (* + ? {a,b}) to token specifications, e.g.: [type="ww.*"]+ (one or more verbs) or "k.*"{3,} (three or more words starting with k) </li>
			<li>You can use match all tokens ([]) to match any word, e.g. "koe" []{1,2} "schaap" to find "koe" and "schaap" in that order with 1-2 words between them. </li>
			<li>You can search within XML tags in the following ways: &lt;ne&gt; "de" (word at start of ne), "poorter" &lt;/ne&gt; (word at end of ne), &lt;ne/&gt; containing "de" (all NEs containing the word "de"), "de" within &lt;ne/&gt; (all occurrences of "de" within an NE), &lt;ne/&gt; (all NEs). Tags may also contain attribute restrictions, such as &lt;ne type="per"/&gt; containing "van" (person names containing "van") </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
