	// Sometimes we get false-positive errors when importing a typescript type definition from a file which itself imported it from a third file
	// The cause for this is the "transpileOnly" setting in our ts-loader configuration above.
	// What happens is a .ts file is passed to the ts-loader, which turns it into a .js file, removing all typescript syntax & annotations

	// But due to the "transpileOnly" flag it does this in isolation, it doesn't inspect WHAT is actually imported.
	// So it leaves in type-only imports like "import { SomeTypeDefinition } from '...'"
	// At the same time, it removes the corresponding export statement "export type SomeTypeDefinition { ... }" from the other file (as that would be meaningless and a syntax error in the plain javascript output)

	// The output .js file is then passed to the next loader in the chain (babel-loader in this case)
	// That loader finds a leftover "import { SomeTypeDefinition }" statement that the ts-loader couldn't remove
	// (again - because it doesn't know whether SomeTypeDefinition is just a type definition or something else, such as an object or a function)
	// But this time, it does try to wire the two files together (to bundle them, to my understanding) and can't find the export statement, thus the warning.

	// We can safely ignore these warnings.
	// We run a second typescript compiler in a separate thread that does do actual deep validation, so we will still get warnings for genuine typescript errors.
	// (that process happens in the ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin we enabled above)
