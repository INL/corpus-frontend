<h2 id="h.hadkwpqzn3vs">About the OpenSoNaR+ application</h2>
<p>The application has been developed in the CLARIN-NL and CLARIAH projects by a joint team of the Dutch Language Institute, Tilburg University and Radboud University. </p>
<p>The application is a web-based frontend for the <a href="http://inl.github.io/BlackLab/">BlackLab</a> search engine for corpora with token-based annotation. The current frontend is a further development of the corpus-frontend application developed by INT (<a href="https://github.com/INL/corpus-frontend">https://github.com/INL/corpus-frontend</a>) and its design is inspired by the first version of the OpenSoNaR user interface by Tilburg and Radboud University (<a href="https://github.com/Taalmonsters/WhiteLab2.0">https://github.com/Taalmonsters/WhiteLab2.0</a>).</p>
<h3 id="h.x2xpd7obyqwk">Information about the corpora published in the application</h3><p>The current application contains two corpora:</p>
<ul><li>The SoNaR corpus contains more than 500 million words of text from various domains and genres. All texts were tokenised, POS tagged and lemmatised. The named entities were also labelled. All annotations of SoNaR were produced automatically. The corpus data are available for researchers, cf. <a href="https://ivdnt.org/downloads/tstc-sonar-corpus">https://ivdnt.org/downloads/tstc-sonar-corpus</a>. More information about the corpus can be found in the corpus documentation at <a href="https://ticclops.uvt.nl/SoNaR_end-user_documentation_v.1.0.4.pdf">https://ticclops.uvt.nl/SoNaR_end-user_documentation_v.1.0.4.</a><a href="https://ticclops.uvt.nl/SoNaR_end-user_documentation_v.1.0.4.pdf">pdf</a>. </li><li>The Corpus of Spoken Dutch (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands, CGN) is a collection of 900 hours (almost 9 million words) of contemporary Dutch speech, originating from Flemish and Dutch speakers. The speech fragments (spontaneous and prepared) are aligned with various transcriptions (including orthographic, phonetic) and annotations (lemma, POS tags). All annotations have been verified manually, except for the phonetic transcription: only 11,3% was verified. The corpus data are available for researchers, cf <a href="https://ivdnt.org/downloads/taalmaterialen/tstc-corpus-gesproken-nederlands">https://ivdnt.org/downloads/taalmaterialen/tstc-corpus-gesproken-nederlands</a>.</li></ul>
